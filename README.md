# Sprung Fever

A 1GAM game for April 2013.

## About

Struggle through the life of a young man who suffers from spring fever.
Everywhere he goes, the boy can't help himself around girls. He is very
impressionable and easily attracted by the young women. Help the young man in
the fight for his life as he goes on exciting adventures to the grocery store,
the mailbox, and returning rental videos!

Just don't let him get sidetracked by cute girls, or he'll fail his exams. The
cuter they are, the worse is gets!
